## App development

Model/View structure:

View is managed by QML
Model is managed by a dedicated class AppModel

AppModel is registered as an instantiable QML object type in a particular type namespace, by calling qmlRegisterType():

qmlRegisterType<Message>("mynamespace", 1, 0, "AppModel");

then in QML : 

import mynamespace 1.0

AppModel is instanciated by the main QML file => this is when its constructor runs.


[FROM DOC]: Q_DECLARE_METATYPE(Type): This macro makes the type Type known to QMetaType as long as it provides a public default constructor, a public copy constructor and a public destructor. It is needed to use the type Type as a custom type in QVariant.
