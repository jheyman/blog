* Roughing + Finish workflow
	* I have run all projets without separating the jobs into roughing toolpaths following by finishing toolpaths, and I should learn how to do this (now that I outgrew Carbide Create)
* Additional endmills
	* one type I would like to try is a compression endmill, to get nice clean edges on top of the material. 
* Touch probe
	* I do not mind the manual zeroing procedure, but for sure it would be cool to get the Carbide3D probe and automate/simplify this step.
* Laser module / laser cutter upgrade
	* They sell laser kits to be mounted on the gantry, which can pretty much transform the Shapeoko into a laser cutter too. But I don't know enough about practical laser cutting yet, and it SEEMS to me that it would be a better idea to get a real/dedicated laser cutter instead, and not have to care about thermal cooling, eye protection, changing the bed of the shapeoko, etc...so we will see. I have been monitoring the release of the Dremel laser cutter (a.k.a Laser cutter for rich dummies), but who knows when it will actually be released (for real).
