Because sometimes remembering past failures and ugly design attemtps is just as helpful as completing successful projects, this page logs a few of my own failed/aborted/bad projects.

### Handcrafted LED matrix

A 16x8 homemade LED matrix I built while experimenting with Arduino and MAX7219.

You don't want to know how long it took me to solder & check everything...which was extremely pointless given that a pre-made LED matrix of similar
dimensions can be bought for a few bucks.

Anyway here is a small video of the result:

### LED POV monster (v0)

Here is the V0 prototype of a rotating LED matrix that was intended as the base for a persistance of vision LED display in 3D.

Notice the massive use of hot-glue, ridiculously large motor, crude assembly, and the painfully designed electronic circuit created on a protoboard with parallel lanes of copper. I sure learned a lot about what *not* to do in this project.

### LED POV monster (v1)

A slightly nicer setup, that I intended to use to create a cylinder-based POV display, but never had the courage to complete

With RPM control knob and RPM value display, brushplate to power the rotating arms, and a nice brushless motor I salvaged from an old RC plane. Too bad I lost interest, maybe one day I will resurrect it.
