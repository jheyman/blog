A 16x8 homemade LED matrix I built while experimenting with Arduino and MAX7219.

You don't want to know how long it took me to solder & check everything...which was extremely pointless given than a pre-made LED matrix of similar
dimensions can be bought for a few bucks.

Here is the V0 prototype of a rotating LED matrix that was intended as the base for a persistance of vision LED display in 3D.

Notice the massive use of hot-glue, ridiculously large motor, crude assembly, and the painfully designed electronic circuit created on a protoboard with parallel lanes of copper. I sure learned a lot about what *not* to do in this project.
