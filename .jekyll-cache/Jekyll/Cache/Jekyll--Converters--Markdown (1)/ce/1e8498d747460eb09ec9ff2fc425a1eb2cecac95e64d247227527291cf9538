<p>Every once in a while, I need to make custom Ethernet cabling. Since I did not bother buying an appropriate RJ45 crimping tool, below are a few notes to manually crimp an RJ45 connector at the end of an Ethernet cable, in desperate situations. The quality of the resulting connection is much less predictable than with a proper tool, but with a lot of caution it works well enough to cover the occasional Ethernet hack emergency.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get an empty RJ45 connector housing</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Cut the CAT5 cable in a nice straight cut.</li>
  <li>Strip off about ~2cm/1inch of the jacket, then order the wires as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>white/orange</li>
      <li>orange</li>
      <li>white/green</li>
      <li>blue</li>
      <li>white/blue</li>
      <li>green</li>
      <li>white/brown</li>
      <li>brown</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>the tricky part: insert the wires in the RJ45 housing, and push until the wires block against the front of plastic housing, <strong>while ensuring that the wires stay in the same order</strong>:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Use a small, thin, flat precision screwdriver like this one:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Using the screwdriver and a small hammer, gently push each individual pin inside the plug, one by one. Here it is halfway done, with the three middle pins already hammered in:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Also push in the plastic thingy that will hold the cable jacket itself, and finally install the plug cover (if any).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hope for the best and test the cable.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
