<p>While I was looking through my archives, I stumbled upon this old piece of code I did back in 2004, when I was experimenting with openGL programming. It renders a few simple effects that have an oldschool-PC-demo feel, and it brought back fond memories so I figured I would archive it properly, and make a video capture of it before it was too late (i.e. SW environments tend to change a lot over the course of a decade, so I may not be able to execute this piece of code a few years from now‚Ä¶)<br /></p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>First up, a text scroller over raster lines and a starfield:

<p>Then, more rasters and a sine scroller with typical chrome-like font:

<p>3D tunnel (slightly modernized with 3D text scroller):

<p>Variation around rasters gone wild and a 3D sine scroller:

<p>Anyone remembers when vertical rasters were a wow effect ?

<p>Twist scroller and sine deformation over a rotozoom:

<p>And finally rising water with bubbles, as a (remote) tribute to the legendary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyzMYzwA6G8">fishtro</a>!

<h2 id="reviving-the-source-code">Reviving the source code</h2>

<p>The implementation is in C++, using OpenGL for graphical rendering, and the BASS library for playing a soundtrack.<br /></p>

<p>The source code is very poorly written, it has all sorts of ‚Äúwow, I would never do it this way nowadays‚Äù parts, but it did put a smile on my face after 12 years (nostalgia!), so it deserves to end up in my github repo if only for that reason.<br /></p>

<p>The code was originally developed in 2004 with whatever version of Visual Studio I had at that time. To rebuild it, I downloaded the latest free version of Visual Studio, i.e. Visual Studio Community 2015, and was pleasantly surprised that the automatic project migration worked just fine !<br /></p>

<p>Only two settings were modified to get the code to build &amp; run:</p>

<ul>
  <li>remove <code>glaux.lib</code> from the kiner dependencies (this library is obsolete and does not exist  / is not necessary anymore)</li>
  <li>disable the <code>SAFESEH</code> option (in Linker advanced options), since the old BASS.dll library I am using is not compatible with this option.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is an additional compilation option issue while building in Debug mode, which I did not care investigating.</p>

<p>The soundtrack is ‚ÄúFellowship‚Äù from 1994 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustaf_Grefberg">Lizardking</a>, possibly one of the greatest demo music composer of old days.</p>
