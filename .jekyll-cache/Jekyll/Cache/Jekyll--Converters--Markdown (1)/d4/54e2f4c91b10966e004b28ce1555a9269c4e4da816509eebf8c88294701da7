<p>Because sometimes remembering past failures and ugly design attemtps is just as helpful as completing successful projects, this page logs a few of my own failed/aborted/bad projects.</p>

<h3 id="handcrafted-led-matrix">Handcrafted LED matrix</h3>

<p>A 16x8 homemade LED matrix I built while experimenting with Arduino and MAX7219.</p>

<p>You donâ€™t want to know how long it took me to solder &amp; check everythingâ€¦which was extremely pointless given that a pre-made LED matrix of similar
dimensions can be bought for a few bucks.</p>

<p>Anyway here is a small video of the result:</p>

<p>Here is the V0 prototype of a rotating LED matrix that was intended as the base for a persistance of vision LED display in 3D.</p>

<p>Notice the massive use of hot-glue, ridiculously large motor, crude assembly, and the painfully designed electronic circuit created on a protoboard with parallel lanes of copper. I sure learned a lot about what <em>not</em> to do in this project.</p>

<h3 id="led-pov-monster-v1">LED POV monster (v1)</h3>

<p>A slightly nicer setup, that I intended to use to create a cylinder-based POV display, but never had the courage to complete</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/MuseumOfHorrors/3DLEDPov_v1.png" alt="3DLEDPov v1" /></p>

<p>With RPM control knob and RPM value display, brushplate to power the rotating arms, and a nice brushless motor I salvaged from an old RC plane. Too bad I lost interest, maybe one day I will resurrect it.</p>
